## 🧠 What Is a Dead Space Trainer?

A **trainer** is a cheat tool that runs alongside your game and gives you real-time control over core mechanics — like health, stasis, oxygen, credits, weapons, and upgrades. It doesn’t replace files or save data — just injects simple memory edits you can **toggle anytime** during gameplay.

Works for the **PC version** of Dead Space Remake (Steam, EA App, Epic Games).
